# CSV Parser
CSV parser with Parser Combinators


**What do you want to learn?**

We want to learn the usage of Scala Library's parser combinators.


**What's the goal?**

Write a simple CSV parser


**What's the result/current status?**

In the first time we tried to build a parser from small parts (Token, Lexer, Parser, ... etc.). We learn some things from browsing the Scala Library's code, but we failed to write anything useful.
In the second time we used the default JavaTokenParsers and wrote the CSV parser.
